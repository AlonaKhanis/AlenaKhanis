<h4 align="center">My coding journey began with my first line of code: "Hello, World!"<br /> Did you know this iconic phrase, credited to computer scientist Brian Kernighan in 1972, was originally used in his book,<br /> "A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B", to demonstrate external variables.</h4>

<h3 align="center">I'm a passionate coder who loves to explore, learn, and tackle challenges head-on. There's no task I can't handle, it's just a matter of time.</h3>
